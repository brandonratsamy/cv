                <li><em> I went to York University to pursue a career in law. I had been in the pre-law program called Law and Society for
        the first 3 years at the university. After my third year, I transfered to the Social Science and Interdisiciplinary 
        Studies program as I did not meet the grade requirement for the Law and Society program which was an honours program.</em></li>

                <li><em>This was my local highschool. At the time, I wasn't sure what I wanted to become. I had a passion for business at the time but decided 
        to pursue a career in law instead. I did not pursue software engineering/computer as it required math as a prerequisite and I had no desire 
        learn math.</em></li>
